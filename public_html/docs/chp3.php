        BAR</span></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The menu bar is the blue bar located just below the title
    window of the screen. This bar will give you information regarding the time,
    provides necessary navigation links and Username with session timeout values.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="style2"><a name="Chp3_Timeanddate"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Time &amp; Date</span></a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This portion of the menu bar is located at the far left.
    Refer to fig 3.1. This displays the time and date at the server location
    which is in Central Daylight Time (CDT). All auction time and dates are listed
    for Central Time. Please be aware that auction opening and closing might
    not be  the same time zone as yours. Auction times
    are covered in more detail in <b><i><a href="chp6_activate.php#createanauction">Creating an Auction</a></i></b>.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/TimeandDate.gif" width="148" height="22">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>fig
    3.1</i></p>
  <p class="style2"><a name="Chp3_Mainmenubar"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Main Menu Bar</span></a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This part of the menu bar is the only part you can interact
    with. There are a few links that you can select..&nbsp; These will be explained
    in more detail in other chapters. Refer to fig 3.2 for the example of the
    Main Menu Bar.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/menubar.gif" width="388" height="19">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>fig
    3.2</i></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The first link is <b>HOME</b>. Wherever you are in the
    site, you can click this link to return to the User’s Home Page as described
    in the <b><i><a href="chp2.php">User’s Home Page</a></i></b> section. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Next is the <b>CREATE AN AUCTION</b>. This section will
    walk you though the steps for entering items and creating an auction. More
  detail on this subject is<span style="font-size: 18pt;"> </span>found in <b><i><a href="chp6.php">Creating an Auction</a></i></b>.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Next is the <b>HELP</b> link. This link is where you will
    find this Help document online.&nbsp; This information is designed to help
    guide you in the use of the site. Other informational items are found here
  including updated information, user agreements, and policies.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Next is the <b>CONTACT US</b> link. This area is used
    for your feedback and suggestions. A form will be displayed for you to fill
    out. If you have questions or issues, please use this form to let us
    know. More detail is given about this area in the <b><i><a href="chp9.php">Contacting
    Us</a></i></b> section. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Last is the <b>LOGOUT</b> link. By clicking this link, you will be securely logged out of the site. It is good practice to logout when you are away from your computer (especially if your computer does not have a lock feature). Staying logged in does not affect the auctions but if you leave your machine, you may leave your information open and unsecured. The best practice is to logout when you are finished or you are going to leave the computer for any length of time. After clicking this link, you will be placed back to the logon screen.</p>
  <p class="style2"><a name="Chp3_Whoisloggedin"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Who is Logged In</span></a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The far right of the menu bar displays who is logged in
    at the current time. Only one (1) account can be logged in at a time. If
    you have multiple users and multiple computers at your facility, each computer
    can have someone logged in at the same time, but only one (1) account per
    computer will function at a time. Next to the username you will see how many
    minutes you have left to be idle until you are automatically logged out.
    Refer to fig 3.3 for an example of the user logged in area. This example
    shows a user with the name “<b>User
    Name</b>”.</p>
