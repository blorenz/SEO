                  <td width="649"><p>Smail Automotive has been in business for over 68 years. Recently
        we have become members of GoDealerToDealer.com. We are very excited about
        the numerous benefits that your site adds to our dealerships business
        model.<br>
        <br>
                    The ability to keep our Sales Managers in-house supporting
                      our retail efforts, as well as controlling our wholesale
                      inventory at the same time makes good business sense.
                      With GoDealerToDealer.com our dealerships will become
                      more efficient in buying and selling wholesale inventory,
      enabling them to save time and money. Dealerships have been missing retail
      opportunities for years by sending staff off to physical auctions. We
      can't retail cars that are sitting at an auction facility. In the past
      this has kept dealers from moving beyond the barriers of buying and selling
      wholesale inventory, putting limits on retail sales. Transporting our
      inventory to a physical auction location is very costly, only to bring
      the units back to the dealership when they don't sell. This is an issue
      that we have been dealing with for years. <br>
        <br>
        Now we don't have to wait until
        the weather is appropriate, or tell our customers that we will try to
        find a vehicle for them this coming week at the auction. We have the
        ability to look at our extended inventory, regardless of weather conditions,
        and close those retail customers while they are hot. <br>
        <br>
        It makes good business
        sense. We no longer have to pay to sell our units wholesale, we have
        access to potentially thousands of additional units, and our sales managers
        never have to leave the dealership! <br>
        <br>
        It is time to “think outside the
        box” and find new, efficient, and profitable
        ways to move inventory. Go Dealer To Dealer has given us that ability. <br>
        <br>
        I would encourage every dealer principal to utilize GoDealerToDealer's
        services. </p>                  </td>

No transportation fees, no sale fees, it's the best way to buy and sell vehicles that I have found. I can buy and sell 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, not just one or two days that the auctions run. I have more time to look over vehicles, I can run a CarFax before I bid, something that I can't do if I am standing at the block bidding on a vehicle.</p>
