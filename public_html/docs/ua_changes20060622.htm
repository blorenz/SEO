  <p align="left" class=MsoNormal><strong>4.5 <u>Lowering the Reserve / Buy Now<br>
  </u></strong>The seller has the option to LOWER the Reserve price and the Buy Now price at anytime during an open auction. Lowering the Reserve price can also be accomplished by selecting the Next Bid Wins option, which will lower the reserve price to $1 above the current high bid. If there are no bids placed on the auction, then the Next Bid Wins option will lower the Reserve to $1 above the starting bid amount. When lowering the Reserve price or Buy Now price, an automated email will be sent <u>only</u> to members who have placed a bid on the auction notifying them of the change and will disclose the NEW Reserve price in the email. The Reserve price will still be hidden from all members on the actual auction page. </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>10.1 </strong><u><strong>Filing a Claim </strong></u><br>
  If a dispute arises under this Agreement, the parties agree to first try to resolve the dispute amongst each other. The claimant (buyer) will notify the respondent (seller) of the dispute and allow the respondent to either agree to refund the item with all fees and documented transportation costs, or reach a mutually acceptable resolution with the claimant or resolve the claim within five business days in accordance with the Arbitration herein. </p>
  <p align="left">If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, the claimant party will submit and online arbitration form which will be assigned to a separate, binding arbitration company. </p>
  <p align="left">Arbitration shall not be available for claims involving the following: </p>
  <p align="left">a. Any dispute amount $400.00 ( US ) or less (before taxes and excluding any inspection, transportation, and/or GDTD fees).<br>
  b. If the item has been in the possession of the claimant for more than 72 hours before making contact with the respondant about the issue. <br>
  c. If the auction has been closed for more that 30 (thirty) days.</p>
  <p align="left">The claimant must file a claim online stating that the respondent misrepresented the condition or description of an item, or failed to make proper disclosure within 72 hours of the item being in the claimant's possession. The online form will be sent to the claimant, the respondent, and the arbitration company which will start the arbitration process. </p>
