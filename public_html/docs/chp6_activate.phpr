<p class="style2"><a name="createanauction">Create an Auction </a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are 2 locations to create an auction. After you enter
  an item and complete the condition report then upload the pictures. On the
  Manage Photos page is a link to Create Auction for that item. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most common is while viewing the <b>My Items </b> page,
    locate the item you want to create an auction for and click the Red link
  to the left that says, “<b>create auction</b>”. This will take you to the Create
  a Wholesale Auction page as shown below in fig 6.6.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/createauction.gif" width="556" height="657"><br>
  <img src="images/createauction1.gif" width="636" height="304"><br>
  <i>fig 6.6</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Above you can see some of the item's details and the main
  photo.  You will need to fill in
  the auction information on this page.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first area to verify is the start and end time of the
  auction. The system will default the <strong>Auction Starts</strong> time to
  be the very next hour that the auction can start. You can change this to any
  time and date as long at it is later than the current time. Remember that all
  times are shown on the site are in Central Time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then <strong>Auction Ends</strong> time is defaulted to
  7 days from now. You have the ability to adjust the time and date to allow
  your auctions to run anytime between 24 hours to 30 days. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next is the <strong>Bid Price Starts At</strong> field.
  This is where you will enter the price the auction will start the bidding.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select the <strong>Bid Increment </strong>that is suitable
  for the item being listed. The increments are set to $1.00, $25.00, $50.00,
  or $100.00 U.S. Dollars. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Reserve Price</strong> field is  the lowest
  acceptable wholesale price for an item.&nbsp;This is an optional entry.
  The bidders will not see this amount. Any bids UNDER this amount will not win.
  Someone must bid  this amount or more to win the auction. If you leave this
  section blank, the Bid price at start will be the lowest acceptable wholesale
  price. You will also be required to check the <strong>Verify NO
  RESERVE</strong> check box to
  verify that you are actually creating a no reserve auction. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next box is the <strong>Disable Bidding</strong> check
  box. This will disable ALL bidding on the item and make the auction a Buy Now
  Only auction and will require a price in the Buy Now Price field. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next field is the “<b>Buy Now Price</b>.” This also
    is an optional entry. When you enter a Buy Now Price you are identifying
  and setting your firm fixed sale price that you will take for your item.&nbsp; This
  amount is shown on the auction bidding page as the “<strong>Buy
  Now Price</strong>”.&nbsp; 
  When a buyer accepts your Buy Now Price it ends the auction. The Buy Now option
  will stay available on the auction until the bidding reaches 1 bid increment
  away from the reserve. At that time, the Buy Now option will disappear and
  normal bidding will resume until the end time of the auction, thus allowing
  the bidding to continue up and past the orginal Buy Now set price. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note: If the reserve was not met on your auction, you can
  re-list your item into a new auction without any re-list fees or no
  sell fees.&nbsp; Plus,
  all of the data, pictures, and prices will still be available so you can reference
  what was entered before.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next is “<strong>Who pays transport.</strong>”&nbsp; You
  need to select who will pay for the item's transportation /shipping cost. You
  can choose the buyer to pay 100% of all transporation fees, or you can choose
  to assist in the transportation cost by selecting another option. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, click the <b>Please Create My Auction</b> button
  to establish the item as a Pending Auction. While your auction is in Pending
  Auction status you can still edit the item's information. Your auction will
  not become an Open Auction until your entered auction start time arrives. <b><u>Please
remember, once your auction is Active, you cannot edit the item information</u></b>;
however, you can add to the description, condition, and add photos if any information
changes during the auction. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can edit or remove
  your Pending Auction item without any removal fee being charged. </p>
<p class="style2"><a name="Chp6_Pulloption"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">
Pull Option </span></a>
<p>The Pull option is available when your auction is Active and prior to your
  stated minimum item price and or reserve price being met or exceeded by a bidder.
  Reference fig 6.7 for an example of a pull option in Open Auctions.</p>
<p><img src="images/OpenAuctions.gif" width="963" height="680"><em>fig 6.7 </em></p>
<p>To pull the auction,
    click the Pull link under the photo on the left. There are NO fees to pull an active auction. If your auction is a &quot;no reserve&quot; auction, then there is no pull option available. This is very important if you
  wish to pull an item off an auction for any reason. Typically, dealers will
  pull an item if it sells retail before the auction ends. See fig 6.8 below
  for an example of a pull auction.</p>
<p><img src="images/PullAuction.gif" width="516" height="306"><br>
  <em>fig. 6.9 </em></p>
<p>When you exercise this option, it ends the auction for that item. The item will remain in your Pulled Items section if you need to re-list the item. </p>
   <p class="style2"><a name="Chp6_Nextbidwins"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">
Next Bid Wins Option </span></a>
<p>Shown with the options in figure 6.8 is &quot;Next Bid Wins&quot;, which
  automatically lowers the reserve price. This lowers the reserve price to $1
  above the current bid. That ensures that the next bidder will meet or exceed
  the reserve price, and that there will be a guaranteed sale.</p>
<p>When this option is selected, a graphic will display on the auction which
  informs anyone who looks at the auction that the reserve has been lowered.
  Plus, the system will email every member who placed a bid on the auction informing
  them that the reserve has been lowered. </p>
<p>All auctions have the ability to lower the reserve at anytime unless the auction
  has no reserve. The Buy Now option also has the ability to be lowered. To lower
  the reserve or Buy Now option, click on the edit link of the auction and type
  in a new value. </p>
<p>Note - the system will not allow you to raise these values. Once lowered,
  they cannot be raised until another auction is created from that item.</p>
<p class="style2"><a name="makeofferbidder">Make Offer to Bidder</a></p>
<p>When an auction ends, the closed auctions are listed in the Closed Auctions
  screen under the Control Panel, in the My Wholesale Auctions page. </p>
<p>If an auction ended without meeting reserve and there was at least 1 bidder
  on the auction, you as the seller have the ability to make an offer to the
  highest bidder. View the Closed Auctions screen as shown in fig 6.10
  below.</p>
<p><img src="images/ClosedAuctions.gif" width="961" height="599"><br>
  <em>fig 6.10</em></p>
<p>Only items with the Make Offer option will be shown with the Make Offer link
  on the left side. There is one item in the example with the Make Offer option.
  To send the highest bidder an offer, simply click on the Make Offer link and
  the Make Wholesale Offer page will display as shown in fig 6.11 below.</p>
<p><img src="images/makeoffertobuyer.gif" width="535" height="633"><br>
  <em>fig 6.11</em></p>
<p>Here we will see the auction ID information, the main photo, Location, and
  the ending bid amount with your reserve. Enter an amount you will want to send
  to the highest bidder for an amount, if they choose to accept, that will be
  agreed upon as a closed auction price. </p>
<p>If the highest bidder accepts this amount,
    it is 


 considered

 a legal sale of the item. If they choose to decline the
  offer, a notice will be sent to your email address with this notification.</p>
<p>The highest bidder can also COUNTER  your offer with a counter offer. Then
  you will have the 


 opportunity

 to Accept, Deny, or counter again. This process
  will continue until either party accepts or denies the offer thus ending the
  offer process.</p>
<p>After this offer is made, you will 


 have

 an alert in the Control Panel that
  states &quot;Make Offer Pending&quot; in red as shown in fig 6.12.</p>
<p><img src="images/makeofferpending.gif" width="252" height="161"><br>
  <em>fig 6.12</em></p>
<p>This alert is here if you wish to &quot;retract&quot; your offer to the seller. To proceed
  to retract the offer, simply click the Make Offer Pending link in the Control
  Panel and click the button at the bottom &quot;Retract your Current Offer&quot;. This
  option will end the offer and will NOT allow another offer to be created for
  this auction. The offer option is over for this auction.</p>
<p>If the 


 highest

 bidder &quot;counters&quot; your offer, you will receive and email and
  an alert in your Control Panel with &quot;You Have Unread Alerts&quot; in red as shown
  in fig 6.13 below.</p>
<p><img src="images/alert.gif" width="252" height="175"><br>
  <em>fig 6.13</em></p>
<p> By selecting the Alert link in the Control Panel, you will see which items
  are Counter Offers. Click on the Counter Offer in question. From here you will
  see some details about the auction, the final bid that was made, the reserve,
  and the amount counter offered from the high bidder. See fig 6.14 below for
  an example of this page. </p>
<p><img src="images/makeoffertobuyer1.gif" width="561" height="599"><br>
  <em>fig 6.14</em></p>
<p> If you agree with this amount, simply click the Accept (SELL) button and
  the item will be considered sold. You may also &quot;counter&quot; the high bidder's
  offer and the process will continue back and forth until either the Accept
  or Decline is chosen. If you choose to Decline, the process is ended and all
  make offer options for this auction are over. </p>
