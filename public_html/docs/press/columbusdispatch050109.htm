              <strong>AUCTION SITE FOR CAR DEALERS INTRODUCED </strong><br>
      Monday, January 09, 2006 <br>

      THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH <br>
      <br>
      While driving home from an auto auction in Columbus, used-car dealer Lewis 
      Bungard thought about not having sold any of his 15 cars on the 90-degree 
      day and that his ears were still ringing from the noise at the event. <br>
            <br>
      "I said, &quot;Lord, there has to be a better way to do this.&quot;" <br>
      <br>
      In September, about five years later, Bungard introduced Godealertodealer-.com,
      based in Gahanna, an enterprise he hopes will become an auction site for
      thousands of licensed dealers selling cars, trucks, motorcycles and other
      vehicles. <br>
            <br>
      Site members can peruse vehicles listed for auction on the site, search
      for specific types of vehicles and sell vehicles. <br>
            <br>
      Bungard doesn't expect the Web site to replace physical auctions, and he 
      knows that large auction companies including Manheim Auctions, which runs 
      Ohio Auto Auction in Columbus began offering online sales since he had his 
      brainstorm in 2000. <br>
            <br>
"There's still opportunity," Bungard said. "There's enough business out there.
The dealers are looking for ways to save money and save time." <br>
      <br>
      Bungard's company faces a wholesale used-car industry that is "about as
      competitive of a market as there is," said George Hoffer, a Virginia Commonwealth
      University professor who studies the industry. <br>
            <br>
"What this guy (Bungard) is trying to do is make the market even more competitive," Hoffer
said. "There is room to do this." <br>
      <br>
      Most of the millions of cars sold wholesale each year in the U.S. are sold
      by dealers, mostly at auction. <br>
            <br>
      But more than half of the cars dealers take to auction are not sold. That
      means dealers are probably open to another channel to sell, Hoffer said. <br>
            <br>
      So far, Godealertodealer.com has about 250 members spread out over nine
      states, and Bungard is waiving the $1,499 annual membership fee for a year
      for the first 300 who sign up. <br>
            <br>
      Traditional bricks-and-mortar auctions don't charge membership fees. But
      Bungard said his site can end up saving dealers money. Aside from avoiding
      the expense of paying employees to attend auctions, Godealertodealer.com <strong>doesn't </strong> charge "sell
      fees" to dealers making transactions. <br>
            <br>
"That can trim more than $100 off the sale of a $10,000 car," he said. <br>
      <br>
      Hoffer said Bungard might be most successful attracting small, independent
      dealers. John Fairbanks, owner of Northgate Auto Sales in Cincinnati, recently
      signed up and said the system works well. <br>
            <br>
"You're able to stay at your business," said Fairbanks, who keeps a small lot
of about 30 cars. "I'm an independent, so when I leave the store, it hurts me.
I've purchased one car off the site, and it went smooth." <br>
      <br>
      Bungard has a "decent idea," but shouldn't be much of a threat to the established
      auction companies," said Rick Pomeroy, general manager of Ohio Auto Auction. <br>
            <br>
      "I don't see a competitive advantage - Manheim's been doing this (online 
      sales) for years," Pomeroy said. "It's another alternative for the car dealer."
