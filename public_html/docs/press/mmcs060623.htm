      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>MMCS, Inc Signs Distribution Agreement with Go DEALER to DEALER</strong></p>
      <p>Motorcycle Management Consulting Services, Inc., a California based consulting firm, has joined forces with Go DEALER to DEALER to introduce the PowerSports industry to a state-of-the-art online wholesale auction service. </p>
      <p>Responding to the challenges of locating, buying and selling inventory and the high cost of traveling to physical auctions, Go DEALER to DEALER has created a venue for dealers to list, buy and sell inventory 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Now, using a fully automated web-based application, dealers can buy and sell from any computer with internet access. </p>
      <p>MMCS, Inc., working with its national network of agents, is proud to 
        offer this innovative solution designed to meet another challenge faced 
        by PowerSports dealers. Julia McCarthy, President of MMCS, Inc. states 
        that &quot;it's interesting that we frequently hear dealers comment about 
        a lack of inventory while others comment about a surplus. Helping those 
        dealers find each other has been a challenge until now. With Go DEALER 
        to DEALER we bring the dealers with a surplus directly to the dealers 
        in need without the cost of travel or transporting inventory.&quot;</p>
      <p>McCarthy says &quot;There are NO membership fees, NO sell fees and NO 
        listing fees for dealers, and dealers feeding PowerSports inventory to 
        the current national PowerSports auction venues should pay particular 
        attention to the &quot;No Sell Fee&quot;policy.&quot;Go DEALER to DEALER 
        also offers a wholesale venue for financial, fleet, lease and rental companies 
        giving corporate remarketers the ability to save millions of dollars in 
        reduced sell fee costs. </p>
      <p>The only fees for dealers participating in the on-line auction are the 
        buy fees paid by the dealer buying a vehicle. These fees are comparable 
        to those charged at a physical auction but the dealer doesn't need to 
        leave his dealership to buy and/or sell. Also, with Go DEALER to DEALER, 
        the dealer can have his vehicles on the showroom floor available for retail 
        sale and as part of a wholesale auction - at the same time!!! </p>
      <p>Lewis F. Bungard, CEO of DEALER to DEALER, L.L.C. ( <a href="http://www.godealertodealer.com/">www.godealertodealer.com 
        </a>) comments that &quot;the site was designed by dealers for dealers, 
        and as the owner of a dealership, I was tired of the unnecessary transportation 
        cost due to inventory not selling at the physical auctions.&quot; Bungard 
        continues “that's why, from the inception of the idea of godealertodealer.com, 
        we knew the value and huge savings to bringing this incredible tool to 
        dealers on a national level.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;We are excited about the relationship with MMCS, Inc and how MMCS 
        will be helping the PowerSports industry by filling the voids that the 
        industry has suffered for decades. Our business is exploding in all industries 
        due to great business relationships like MMCS, Inc. and others&quot;</p>
      <p>MMCS, Inc., and Go DEALER to DEALER bring the wholesale auctions to you! </p>
