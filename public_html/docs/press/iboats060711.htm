      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>iboats.com Partners with Go DEALER to DEALER </strong></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>to Provide Wholesale Boat Auction Services </strong></p>
      <p>iboats.com has signed an agreement with Go DEALER to DEALER to provide their extensive dealer base with wholesale boat auction services powered by an online wholesale auction process. iboats.com is the largest full-featured Internet-based company serving both recreational boaters and marine businesses in the $36 billion dollar marine industry. </p>
      <p>Drew McFadden, VP of Marketing Services at iboats.com, said, &quot;In 
        addition to the host of services iboats.com currently offers, we are always 
        seeking opportunities to enhance our dealers' experience. This new agreement 
        allows our dealers to have pre-owned and non-current inventory available 
        for retail and wholesale purchase at the same time.&quot;</p>
      <p>McFadden continues, &quot;There is a nearly $8 billon market in pre-owned 
        boat sales, most of which take place outside the industry. By giving our 
        dealers the safety net of a wholesale marketplace, we're enabling them 
        to take trade-ins and take advantage of this lucrative but largely untapped 
        market with confidence.&quot;</p>
      <p>David Smalley (CIO of Go DEALER to DEALER) states, &quot;This system has been designed with a number of dealers and marine companies to provide precisely   what is needed and what has been missing from the industry. The site is custom designed for each industry, thus providing the data that reflects those needs. Our direct involvement with MATES allows us to create industry standard data flow with the ability to accept direct feeds from companies like iboats.com.These critical feeds allow dealers to quickly and easily manage their inventory and create wholesale auctions.&quot;</p>
      <p>“We are excited about the relationship with iboats.com and the unique 
        program we have developed,” states Lewis Bungard , CEO and founder of 
        Go DEALER to DEALER. &quot;Our business is expanding in the marine, power 
        sports, automotive and RV industries due to great business relationships 
        like the one we formed with iboats.com.&quot;</p>
      <p><strong><em> </em></strong>Bungard founded the company in 2000 to respond to the challenges of locating, buying and selling wholesale inventory as well as the high cost and time of transporting units to physical auctions. Go DEALER to DEALER, based in Gahanna, Ohio, has created a wholesale venue for dealers to list, buy and sell wholesale inventory 24/7. Now, using a fully automated web-based application, dealers can buy and sell wholesale inventory from any computer with Internet access. </p>
      <p>iboats.com, a privately-owned corporation based in Draper, Utah, supports thousands of marine retailers in North America, offering them business solutions in the form of online boat-listing services, personalized web sites and e-commerce capabilities, a boat and motor leads program, and significant traffic directed to participating retailers' web sites and physical establishments. </p>
