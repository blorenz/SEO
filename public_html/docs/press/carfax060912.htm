      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>CarFAX Joins Technology with Go DEALER to DEALER for Online Wholesale Auctions</strong></p>
      <p>Go DEALER to DEALER today announced their dealer customers will have access  to Carfax Vehicle History Reports for every car it sells.&nbsp; This is the  first step in dealers protecting themselves against buying used vehicles with  costly hidden problems. <br>
David Smalley, Chief Information  Officer of Go DEALER to DEALER says &quot;This project adds value to each  auction by enabling sellers the ability to extend their CarFAX contract into  their online wholesale market place at no additional cost. Also bidders can see  the FULL CarFAX report at no cost, as long as the selling dealer has already  ran the report. If not, the bidding dealer still has the opportunity to  purchase the full report. This service is available to every auto and truck  auction, nationwide.&quot;<br>
Lewis Bungard, founder and CEO of  Go DEALER to DEALER says &quot;we are excited about our new relationship with  CarFAX and the unique program we have created. Our business is expanding in the  automotive, marine, power sports and RV industries due to great business  relationships like the one we formed with CarFAX. &quot;<br>
Bungard founded the company in 2000 to respond to the challenges of  locating, buying and selling wholesale inventory as well as the high cost and  time of transporting units to physical auctions. Go DEALER to DEALER, based in  Gahanna, Ohio, has created a wholesale venue for dealers to list, buy and sell  wholesale inventory 24/7. Now, using a fully automated web-based application,  dealers can buy and sell wholesale inventory from any computer with Internet  access.
