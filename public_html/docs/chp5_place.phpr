  <p class="style2"><span style=""><a name="placingthebid">Placing the Bid</a></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Bidding can only be done by a User with an account that has privileges to 

bid on auctions. This is managed through My Control Panel which is covered in <b><i><a 

href="chp7.php">My Control Panel</a></i></b>. For now, we 

are going to assume you have permissions to bid on an auction.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"> The
    first

thing that is necessary is to  find an  open auction
    that you would like to bid on. 

To do this, you will need to search or browse the database and select an item
you wish to bid 

on.&nbsp; Searching is discussed previously in <b><i><a 

href="chp4.php">Searching</a></i></b>.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Once you find the auction in a list, simply click on the link of the 

auction. This could be the Title or the Description of the auction depending on how you found 

the auction. When you click on the link, the actual auction page is displayed as shown in fig 

5.1 below.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/auction.gif" width="599" height="847"><br>
  <i>fig 5.1</i></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In this example, we have bid on this item and are currently
    winning at $27,500.00. We can tell this by looking under the photo and viewing &quot;You
    Are Currently Winning This Auction&quot; in
    green writing. This is visible to any user with Buying privileges when they
    view this auction. This will prevent other buyers to accidentally bid against
    each other inside the same dealership. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">We can also see that our bid has met the reserve by viewing
    the reserve met in green under the current bid. If the reserve was NOT met,
    the words &quot;reserve not met&quot; would display in the same location. Setting reserves
    are done by the seller and are explained in the

  <b><i><a href="chp6.php">Creating an Auction</a> </i></b>section. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The bid increment
    has been set by the seller for the amount of $100.00 per bid because the
    

next bid on the Place Bid button is $27,600.00. All money amounts are always
listed in US 

dollars. We can see how long the auction has before closing and when it started
and when it 

ends. *NOTE* All auction start and end times are listed in Central Time.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The location of the item is shown at the TOP of the auction.
    The transport fees will be paid by
    whoever is listed in the <b><i>Who Pays Transport 
  
</i></b>section.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Below this is the seller's supplied <b>Item</b><b> 

Description</b>, and <b>Condition Report</b>.&nbsp; Any extra photos that the
seller has uploaded are displayed below the Condition Report.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">To place a bid for this auction, simply click  the <b>Place
      Bid</b> 

button. Below the Place Bid amount is the estimated Buy Fee that you will be
entered into your invoice to be collected once a month. This is an estimated
fee since it is impossible to determine the end auction price. The Buy Now fee
is an absolute value assigned to the Buy Now Price. When you  click the <b>Place
Bid </b>button, the bid screen appears. You have the option to enter a 


 Maximum


bid amount in the section provided. The system will bid for you against other
bidders until their bid amount exceeds your maximum bid (also known as proxy
bidding). See fig 5.2 below for an example of the bid confirmation screen.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img 

src="images/ConfirmBid.gif"  border="0" height="323" width="485"></p>
  <p><em>fig 5.2</em></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">You will be notified by e-mail that you have successfully
    placed a bid for this auction. In the email you will be informed if you met
    the reserve or not. Also the email will show which user in your Dealership
    placed the bid. You will be notified if you are out bid, and if you win the
    auction.&nbsp; When you are the Auction Winner, your e-mail notification
    will have instructions on how to contact the seller and for transportation
    and payment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">You can view your current bids from the control panel
    which is covered in <b><i><a href="chp7.php">My Control Panel</a></i></b>.</p>
  <p class="style2"><a name="Chp5_Buynowfeature"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Buy
    Now</span></a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">To purchase the item right away without having to wait
    till the end of auction time is to click on the Buy Now button. This option
    is only available if the seller offers the Buy Now feature. There are no
    additional fees (other than the normal buy fee) by using the Buy Now feature
    as a seller or a buyer. This auction example has a Buy Now button showing
    with the seller's entered Buy Now purchase amount. When you click the Buy
    Now button you are agreeing to purchase the item for the amount shown and
    end the auction so no other dealers are able to bid.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    auction will then immediately end and you will be the winner of this auction.    </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In our example above, the Buy Now option is $29,000.00
    and the buy fee is $316.10. </p>
  <p class="style2"><a name="watchlist">Watch List</a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">You can also watch this auction by clicking on the <strong>Add
      to my watch list</strong> button located to the far right of the page.
      Once you click the button, the Email Reminder page is displayed
      as shown in fig 5.3 below.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/EmailReminder.gif" width="519" height="501"><br>
    <em>fig 5.3 </em>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">You can select the exact day and time you would like to
    receive the email notification warning you this auction is about to close.
  The default selection is 5 hours before the auction ends. If you choose to
    change the date and time, click the submit button to save your changes.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This will add the auction to a list of other watched items
    making it easy to monitor the status without having to place bids on auctions.
        Also, the ability to quickly go back into an auction without having to
        re-search for the item again. See fig 5.3 below for the My Watch List.<br>
    <img src="images/watchlist.gif" width="892" height="420"><em>fig 5.3 </em></p>
  <p class="style2"><a name="requestauction">Request Auction</a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When searching or browsing auctions and you notice an
    item with &quot;Request Auction&quot; in the auction title, this states that the item
    is not currently in an active auction. You have the ability to request the
    seller to create an auction for this item.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">To do this, simply click the request auction link in the
    auction title. The item is displayed with all information related except
    any bidding capability. See fig 5.4 below for an example of a request auction
    item.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/requestauction.gif" width="641" height="789"></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><em>fig 5.4</em></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The item's condition report may be missing as this item
    may never have been in an auction and will still need the seller to finish
    the condition before an actual auction will be created for you to bid on.
    Clicking the Request Auction button in the green panel will initiate an Auction
    Request for the item. The selling dealer will receive an alert in the Control
    Panel when they login to the system as shown below in fig 5.5.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/auctionrequest.gif" width="252" height="160"><br>
    <em>fig 5.5</em></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When the seller clicks on the Auctions Requested link,
    they are shown a list of all Alerts in the system. Clicking the VEW link
    will allow the seller to choose whether to <strong>Create Auction</strong>,
    <strong>Remove Item</strong> or <strong>Dismiss Request</strong>. See fig
    5.6 below for an example of this Auction Request for the seller.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/auctionrequest1.gif" width="687" height="719"><br>
    <em>fig 5.6
  </em> </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">If the seller chooses to Create the Auction, they must
    finish the item's description and condition. Then fill out the auction information
    page. Once the item is up for auction, an email is sent to the requesting
    dealership(s) notifying them that the auction is ready for bidding.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">If the seller chooses to Remove the Item, the item is
    removed from the inventory and an email is generated to all requesting dealers
    notifying them that the item is no longer 


 available

 for auction.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Dismiss Request is available to cancel the auction request
    but also allow does not delete the item from the inventory.</p>
