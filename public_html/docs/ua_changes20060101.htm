  <hr>
  <p align="left"><u><strong>Page 1 - Addition to opening paragraph:</strong></u><br>
    <strong>Participants are also prohibited to use the GDTD system which violates any federal, state, and/or local laws or in a manner which violates the member's franchise agreement.</strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>3.3 <u>Buyer to Make Offer </u><br>
  </strong>The highest bidder at the end of the auction in which the reserve was NOT met, has the ability to make an offer to the selling dealer. By selecting this option, you may enter the amount you wish to offer to the seller. An alert and an email are sent to both seller and buyer. Your alert is available for you to retract your offer. The selling dealer has the ability to accept, deny, or counter offer. This process will continue until one member chooses an option or retracts the offer. If an “accept” is chosen by either party, the item will be considered a sold unit and a completed auction. The Buy Fee will then be assessed. </p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>3.5 <u>Alerts</u> </strong><br>
Alerts are used throughout the system to immediately notify the participant of particular items. Direct Messages sent from GDTD staff and offers placed by other participants for auctions that have closed without meeting the assigned reserve price. The alert notification in the Control Panel will only display if there is an actual alert for that participant. </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>4.2 <u>Selling</u> (addition) <br>
  </strong>If the seller is not able to complete the transaction of the listed item after the close of the auction, all fees associated with the transaction will be reversed from the buyer to the seller.<br>
  In an event where neither party (Buyer or Seller) is at fault for a failed transaction, documented proof, including pictures, or any other information will be necessary to clear fees associated with the transaction.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>4.3 <u>Seller to Make Offer</u><br>
  </strong>If an auction ends without meeting the assigned reserve value, the seller has the ability to make an offer to the highest bidding member. By selecting this option, the seller may enter the amount  to offer to the highest bidder. An alert and an email are sent to both the seller and the highest bidder. The seller's alert is available  if needed to retract the offer. The highest bidding member has the ability to accept, deny, or counter the offer. This process will continue until one member chooses an option or retracts the offer. If an “accept” is chosen by either member, the item will be considered a sold unit and a completed auction. </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>10. <u>Mediation and Arbitration </u></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>10.1 </strong><u><strong>Filing a Claim </strong></u><br>
If a dispute arises under this Agreement, the parties agree to first try to resolve
  the dispute amongst each other. The Buyer will notify the Seller and GDTD of
  the dispute and allow the Seller to either agree to refund the item with all
  fees and documented transportation costs, or reach a mutually acceptable resolution
  with the Buyer or resolve the claim within five business days in accordance
  with the Arbitration herein. </p>
  <p align="left">If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory
    solution through mediation, the parties agree to submit the dispute to the
    assigned binding arbitration company, Judicial Alternatives. </p>
  <p align="left">Arbitration shall not be available for claims involving the
    following: </p>
  <p align="left">a. Any dispute amount $400.00 ( US ) or less (before taxes
    and excluding any GDTD fees) <br>
  b. If the item has been in the possession of the buyer for more than 72 hours </p>
  <p align="left">The Buyer must file a claim with Judicial Alternatives stating
    that the Seller misrepresented the condition or description of an item, or
    failed to make proper disclosure within 72 hours of the item being in the
    Buyer's possession. The Buyer will contact Judicial Alternatives at (614)
    875-9812. An email will be sent from the Buyer with all contact, auction
    information, and description of the claim to <a href="mailto:claims@godealertodealer.com">claims@godealertodealer.com </a>. </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>10.2 <u>Arbitration Fees</u></strong> <br>
  An initial filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100 US) must be paid by the
    Buyer within 72 hours of the filing of the claim by a method stated when
    filing the claim. A claim will be considered filed when the initial call
    is placed to Judicial Alternatives, but not become “active” until confirmation
    is received that the filing fee has been tendered. <br>
  The Arbitrator, or expert appointed by the Arbitrator, will review the auction
  information, and may inspect the item. The Arbitrator may then issue a decision
  or require the Buyer and Seller to provide written evidence and written submissions
  along with photos following which the Arbitrator shall make a final decision.
  The Arbitrator may also permit oral submissions by way of teleconference. If
  the Arbitrator finds that the Seller misrepresented the condition of the item,
  or failed to disclose information as required by this agreement with respect
  to a condition or description, where the costs of correcting or repairing such
  condition, or the difference in value of the item as a result of the condition
  is deemed by the Arbitrator exceeds $400.00 before tax (the “Deemed Amount”),
  then the Arbitrator shall order that the Seller refund the auction close amount,
  all documented transportation fees, and all GDTD fees associated with the transaction,
  or adjust the close auction price to a mutually agreed upon price. The Seller
  will also be assigned the responsibility to pay any and all Arbitration costs,
  including the initial $100 filing fee. If the Deemed Amount is less than $400.00,
  or the Arbitrator finds no action against the Seller, the Arbitrator shall
  dismiss the claim and direct that the Buyer pay all costs of the Arbitration. </p>
  <p align="left">If an arbitration hearing is conducted pursuant to the above
    mediation process, and the claimed amount is less than three thousand dollars
    ($3,000 US), an additional fee of one hundred dollars ($100 US) shall be
    paid by both the Buyer and the Seller. If the claimed amount is three thousand
    dollars ($3,000 US) or more, then the additional fee to both the Buyer and
    the Seller will be five hundred dollars ($500 US). </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>10.3 <u>Arbitration Process</u></strong> <br>
  The Buyer and Seller shall be notified of the date, time and method of hearing
    by fax or email. The hearing shall be conducted by telephone with all parties
    participating and having an ability to hear the testimony of the other party
    and to hear the assigned arbitrator. At this hearing, the Buyer shall proceed
    first and shall explain the claim and give justification or reasons to support
    it. The Buyer may have other persons with knowledge of the claim offer their
    verbal statement. The Seller shall proceed after the conclusion of Buyer's
    presentation and shall offer any justification or reasons that the claim
    is not accurate or that an award is not appropriate. The Seller may have
    other persons with knowledge of the claim offer their verbal statement as
    well. An electronic record shall be made of all oral statements of the parties
    and other persons. </p>
  <p align="left">At the conclusion of the presentations of the parties, the
    arbitrator shall consider all the material presented by the parties, their
    statements, and the statements of other persons made during the hearing and
    shall issue a final and binding decision in writing that shall decide the
    issues presented based solely upon the information presented by the parties
    and the law of the jurisdiction governing the contract or dispute. The arbitration
    decision shall briefly explain the reason for the award. The decision shall
    be issued and faxed or emailed to the parties within 24 hours of the arbitration
    hearing. </p>
  <div align="left"><strong>10.4 <u>Appointment of Arbitrator </u></strong><br>
  Judicial Alternatives shall, through the program administrator, appoint one of
  the jurists serving on the panel of Judicial Alternatives as the sole arbitrator
  for each case. A jurist is a properly licensed attorney in any state who has
  previous experience as a judge on a state or federal court which had subject
  matter jurisdiction of the same types of disputes submitted under this program.
  The jurist appointed shall certify to the parties that the jurist has no conflict
  of interest, bias, prejudice or interest in any claim referred to them by Judicial
  Alternatives. The jurist selected shall be paid by Judicial Alternatives a fee
  reflective of the time spent resolving the dispute submitted regardless of its
  outcome.
  </div>
  <p align="left">If a party objects to the appointment of a jurist, that objection
  shall be filed within 24 hours of their appointment and shall be resolved by
  the program administrator immediately. The decision of the program administrator
  is final and binding upon the parties. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>10.5 <u>Appointment of Costs and Fees </u></strong><br>
  The arbitrator may in their discretion award filing fees and costs paid to
    Judicial Alternatives as cost to a prevailing party in the arbitration award.
    Such decisions are final and binding and become part of the award. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>10.6 <u>Arbitration Judgment</u></strong> <br>
  The following rules will apply to the Arbitration Act: </p>
<p align="left">a. All decisions of the arbitrator are FINAL and BINDING upon
  the parties and shall be enforceable as a judgment in any state or federal
  court having jurisdiction. There shall be no rights of appeal from any such
  decisions. </p>
<p align="left">b. Judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered
  in any court having jurisdiction. </p>
<p align="left">c. In the case of an item refund, the costs of the item Arbitration
  shall include all costs payable for the Arbitrator's fees (including the inspection),
  the transportation fees of the item, all GDTD fees, and in respect to items
  exported, additional export related costs. </p>
<p align="left">d. The decision of whether to permit written evidence, written
  submissions, photos, or oral submissions, is in the absolute discretion of
  the Arbitrator. </p>
<div align="left">Under no circumstance whatsoever is GDTD (and any staff of GDTD) liable or responsible
  for any arbitration, judgment, or resolution.
