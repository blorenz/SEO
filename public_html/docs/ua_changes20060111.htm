If an auction ends without meeting the assigned reserve value, the highest bidder
    has the ability to make an offer to the selling member. By selecting this
    option, you may enter the amount you wish to offer to the seller. An alert
    and an email are sent to both seller and buyer. Your alert is available for
    you to retract your offer. The selling dealer has the ability to accept,
    deny, or counter offer. This process will continue until one member chooses
    an option or retracts the offer. If an “accept” is
    chosen by either party, the item will be considered a sold unit and a completed
    auction. The Buy Fee will then be assessed. The Make Offer option is only
    available to the user id who made the bid.</span></p>

    bidding member has the ability to accept, deny, or counter the offer. This
    process will continue until one member chooses an option or retracts the
    offer. If an “accept” is chosen by either member, the item will be considered
    a sold unit and a completed auction. The Make Offer option is only available
    to the user id who created the auction. </p>
