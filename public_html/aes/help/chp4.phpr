<p align="center" class="style1">ALERTS</p>
<p><br>
The Alerts section provides very important information directed to you. If someone
  internal or a user at a dealership has sent you an Alert, it will display here.
  If there are no alerts in your system, the banner bar will be blue and show
  that there are no alerts. When there is an alert, the bar will become red and
  display how many alerts you have stored. The alerts are broken down into categories
  for easier viewing and understanding. These categories are explained in more
  detail below. View fig 4.1 below for an example of the Alerts section. </p>

  <em>fig 4.1
  </em></p>
<p class="style2">New Dealer Signup <a name="newdealersignup" id="newdealersignup"></a>
<p>When a dealer has signed up via the online form, Corporate Office will verify
  the quality of the information and assign this dealer to your group. This dealer
  will be stored in the saved dealers section and an alert will be shown. This
  section will show you all of your recently assigned dealers. Once you make
  a modification to the file, the dealer will no longer show in your New Dealer
  Signup section. <p class="style2">Alerts From DM <a name="alertsfromdm" id="alertsfromdm"></a>
<p>This section will show a number if you have an alert or instant message from
  your District Manager. By clicking on this link will take you to the My Alerts
  section as shown below in fig 4.2.
<p><img src="images/myalerts.gif" width="599" height="198"><br>
  <em>fig 4.2</em>
<p>Here you will see ALL of your instant messages. You will see in red the message
  from your district manager. You simply need to click on the VIEW link to display
  the message as shown in fig 4.3 below.
<p><img src="images/readmessage.gif" width="500" height="352"><br>
  <em>fig 4.3</em>
<p>From here, you can reply to the message which will in turn, display an alert
  on their screen. Or you can delete the message or just return to the main menu.
  The alerts will stay in your system for as long as you want. This tool is only
  designed to allow quick and easy communication to other parties and should
  NOT be used in place of real e-mail systems. 
<p class="style2">Alerts from other AEs <a name="alertsfromae" id="alertsfromae"></a>
<p>This section is exactly like the Alerts From DM section above except the people
  who will send you alerts in this section are other Account Executives in your
  District Manager's group. You will not be able to send instant messages to
  other AE's in another DM's group. The messages from other AE's will be displayed
  as green in color. <p class="style2">Alerts From Dealerships <a name="alertsfromdealer" id="alertsfromdealer"></a>
<p>This section again is like the Alerts From DM section above except the people
  who will send you alerts in this section are users at one of your dealerships.
  Only dealers in your dealer base will be able to send you instant messages
  and you will only be able to send your dealers instant messages. <p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="index.php">Table of Contents</a></p>
