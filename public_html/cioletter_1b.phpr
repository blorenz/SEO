3. Online Advertising Service
GDTD may be called an Online Auction. However, GDTD is only an online electronic advertising service. The GDTD Web Site allows GDTD authorized participants to buy and sell authorized items. You (Dealer / FC) agree without any reservation or condition that GDTD is not involved in the actual business transaction between you as a buyer or seller of any item listed on the website. GDTD has no control over the accuracy or truthfulness of the Dealer / FC listing information. You (Dealer / FC) are solely responsible for the content and truthfulness of your listed information. The Dealer / FC's responsibility for listing information includes, but is not limited to, item description, condition, safety, quality, and availability for legal sale or purchase. GDTD does not provide any warranties, expressed or implied, to any Dealer / FC for any item listed / advertised on the website. We will strive to operate the online GDTD website on an ongoing basis. However, due to possible unforeseen electronic, mechanical and power failures, the website may not continuously operate without interruption or error.

You (Dealer / FC) are solely responsible for all information you provide to GDTD or list on the website. You (Dealer / FC) agree that you will not interfere in anyway with the function of the online website.



3.2 Bidding and Buying
When you (Dealer) enter a bid for an item on the GDTD website, you accept the seller's descriptive information and the seller's listed conditions for the sale of the item, and your bid is not retractable or revocable. When you (Dealer) are the highest bidder at the end of the auction, having met or exceeded the seller's reserve price and /or accepted the Seller's "Buy Now" option, you accept the seller's lawful listed conditions for sale. You are then obligated to purchase the item and pay any fees associated with the item, unless your purchase would be prohibited by this agreement or by law. GDTD will send the Winning Bidder / Buyer an e-mail notification at the close of the Online Auction. This e-mail will include contact information about the seller so you can contact the seller directly. You should contact the seller within 24 hours to coordinate payment for and transfer of the item you are buying.

 

3.3 Bidder to Make Offer 
If an auction ends without meeting the assigned reserve value, the highest bidder has the ability to make an offer to the selling member. By selecting this option, you may enter the amount you wish to offer to the seller. An alert and an email are sent to both seller and buyer. Your alert is available for you to retract your offer. The selling dealer has the ability to accept, deny, or counter offer. This process will continue until one member chooses an option or retracts the offer. If an "accept" is chosen by either party, the item will be considered a sold unit and a completed auction. The Buy Fee will then be assessed. The Make Offer option is only available to the user id who made the bid.

 

3.4 Incremental Bid Amounts
Incremental bid amounts are set by the Seller in increments of $1.00, $25.00, $50.00, and $100.00 U.S. Dollars. The bidder may enter a Maximum Bid (Proxy Bid) for an item that they are willing to pay for the item. For a Maximum Bid / Proxy Bidding Dealer, GDTD will increase the Dealer's bid in increments set by the Seller in U.S. Dollars against competing bids, and reserve, as long as the bid does not exceed the bidding Dealer's stated Maximum Bid. Only amounts greater than current bid price will be entered and displayed. When a Dealer enters a bid it is not retractable or revocable. 

3.5 Alerts 
Alerts are used throughout the system to immediately notify the participant of particular items. Direct Messages sent from GDTD staff and offers placed by other participants for auctions that have closed without meeting the assigned reserve price. The alert notification in the Control Panel will only display if there is an actual alert for that participant. 

3.6 Release
You (Dealer / FC) and GDTD are independent business entities and no joint venture, partnership, franchise, or employment relationship is created by entering into this agreement. As an online auction (advertising service) GDTD is not involved in the actual business transaction between Dealers (buyers and/or sellers) and FC (sellers). If you (Dealer / FC) have any dispute with another Dealer / FC, you release Dealer To Dealer L.L.C., dba Go Dealer To Dealer and all of our directors, officers, agents, subsidiaries, employees, and contractors from any and all claims connected in anyway with any such dispute.

All inventory listed is available for searching regardless of auction status. Only items in an active auction are available for bidding. All other inventory will have the ability for Auction Requests. An e-mail confirmation will be sent upon successful completion of the item's pending auction. The e-mail will show all information regarding the item and its auction. GDTD reserves the right (and will assume no obligation) to delete, move, or edit any items or auctions which violate this agreement, or that we consider unacceptable or inappropriate.

4.2 Auto Feeds

The Dealer / FC can assign a 3rd party company to list inventory on behalf of them. The Dealer / FC will accept full ownership and responsibility for all listed inventory. It will be the responsibility of the Dealer / FC to create the auctions for the listed inventory manually. Once the auction is created, the Dealer / FC verifies the validity of the 3rd party's information and pictures. All inventory regardless of auction status will be available for searching. Only active auctions will be available for bidding or purchasing. Items that are not in an active auction, will be available for other member to request an auction. The selling dealer will have the choice to create the auction from this request, dismiss the request or delete the item. And email will be sent to the requesting dealer with notification of the action taken. 

 

 

4.3 Auto Delete

All inventory that is auto feed into the system will be available for auto delete. When the 3rd party listing / feeding company sends the delete code or no longer sends the item with the Dealer / FC's current inventory, the deleted or missing item will be deleted from the Dealer / FC's online inventory automatically. If the item is in an active auction, an email and an alert will be generated warning the Dealer / FC of the issue. The Dealer / FC will then be required to pull the auction manually.

 

4.4 Selling

The seller must have Title / Certificate documents for each listed item readily available for transfer to the buying Dealer. GDTD will send you (Seller) an e-mail notification at the close of the Online Auction. This e-mail will include contact information about the winning bidder so you can contact the Winning Bidder / Buyer directly. You should contact the winning bidder / buyer within 24 hours to coordinate payment for and transfer of the item you are selling. If you (Seller) receive a bid at or in excess of your listed minimum (or reserve) price you are obligated to complete the transaction with the identified highest bidder upon the auction's close, unless the transaction is prohibited by law. If the seller is not able to complete the transaction of the listed item after the close of the auction, all fees associated with the transaction will be reversed from the buyer to the seller. 
In an event where neither party (Buyer or Seller) is at fault for a failed transaction, documented proof, including pictures, or any other information will be necessary to clear fees associated with the transaction. 

 

4.5 Lowering the Reserve / Buy Now

The seller has the option to LOWER the Reserve price and the Buy Now price at anytime during an open auction. Lowering the Reserve price can also be accomplished by selecting the Next Bid Wins option, which will lower the reserve price to $1 above the current high bid. If there are no bids placed on the auction, then the Next Bid Wins option will lower the Reserve to $1 above the starting bid amount. When lowering the Reserve price or Buy Now price, an automated email will be sent only to members who have placed a bid on the auction notifying them of the change and will disclose the NEW Reserve price in the email. The Reserve price will still be hidden from all members on the actual auction page. 

 

4.6 Seller to Make Offer 
If an auction ends without meeting the assigned reserve value, the seller has the ability to make an offer to the highest bidding member. By selecting this option, the seller may enter the amount to offer to the highest bidder. An alert and an email are sent to both the seller and the highest bidder. The seller's alert is available if needed to retract the offer. The highest bidding member has the ability to accept, deny, or counter the offer. This process will continue until one member chooses an option or retracts the offer. If an "accept" is chosen by either member, the item will be considered a sold unit and a completed auction. The Make Offer option is only available to the user id who created the auction.

If a dispute arises under this Agreement, the parties agree to first try to resolve the dispute amongst each other. The claimant (buyer) will notify the respondent (seller) of the dispute and allow the respondent to either agree to refund the item with all fees and documented transportation costs, or reach a mutually acceptable resolution with the claimant or resolve the claim within five business days in accordance with the Arbitration herein. 

If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, the claimant party will submit and online arbitration form which will be assigned to a separate, binding arbitration company. 

Arbitration shall not be available for claims involving the following: 

a. Any dispute amount $400.00 ( US ) or less (before taxes and excluding any inspection, transportation, and/or GDTD fees).

10.2 Arbitration Fees 
An initial filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100 US) must be paid by the claimant within 72 hours of the filing of the claim by a method stated when filing the claim. A claim will be considered filed when the initial online arbitration form is submitted, but will not become "active" until confirmation is received that the filing fee has been tendered.

The respondent will also be assigned the responsibility to pay any and all Arbitration costs, including the initial $100 filing fee. If the Deemed Amount is less than $400.00, or the Arbitrator finds no action against the respondent, the Arbitrator shall dismiss the claim and direct that the claimant pay all costs of the Arbitration.

If the claimed amount is three thousand dollars ($3,000 US) or more, then the additional fee to both the claimant and the respondent will be five hundred dollars ($500 US). 

10.3 Arbitration Process

The hearing shall be conducted by telephone with all parties participating and having an ability to hear the testimony of the other party and to hear the assigned arbitrator. At this hearing, the claimant shall proceed first and shall explain the claim and give justification or reasons to support it. The claimant may have other persons with knowledge of the claim offer their verbal statement. The respondent shall proceed after the conclusion of claimant's presentation and shall offer any justification or reasons that the claim is not accurate or that an award is not appropriate. The respondent may have other persons with knowledge of the claim offer their verbal statement as well. An electronic record shall be made of all oral statements of the parties and other persons. 

At the conclusion of the presentations of the parties, the arbitrator shall consider all the material presented by the parties, their statements, and the statements of other persons made during the hearing and shall issue a final and binding decision in writing that shall decide the issues presented based solely upon the information presented by the parties and the law of the jurisdiction governing the contract or dispute.

The jurist selected shall be paid by the arbitration company a fee reflective of the time spent resolving the dispute submitted regardless of its outcome. 

If a party objects to the appointment of a jurist, that objection shall be filed within 24 hours of their appointment and shall be resolved by the program administrator immediately. The decision of the program administrator is final and binding upon the parties in all 50 states in the United States . 

10.5 Appointment of Costs and Fees 
The arbitrator may in their discretion award filing fees and all costs associated to the case as cost to a prevailing party in the arbitration award. Such decisions are final and binding and become part of the award. 

10.6 Arbitration Judgment 
The following rules will apply to the Arbitration Act:

10. Mediation and Arbitration 

10.1 Filing a Claim 
If a dispute arises under this Agreement, the parties agree to first try to resolve the dispute amongst each other. The claimant (buyer) will notify the respondent (seller) of the dispute and allow the respondent to either agree to refund the item with all fees and documented transportation costs, or reach a mutually acceptable resolution with the claimant or resolve the claim within five business days in accordance with the Arbitration herein. 

If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, the claimant party will submit and online arbitration form which will be assigned to a separate, binding arbitration company. 

Arbitration shall not be available for claims involving the following: 

a. Any dispute amount $400.00 ( US ) or less (before taxes and excluding any inspection, transportation, and/or GDTD fees)
b. If the item has been in the possession of the claimant for more than 72 hours
c. If the auction has been closed for more that 30 (thirty) days 

The claimant must file a claim online stating that the respondent misrepresented the condition or description of an item, or failed to make proper disclosure within 72 hours of the item being in the claimant's possession. The online form will be sent to the claimant, the respondent, and the arbitration company which will start the arbitration process. 

10.2 Arbitration Fees 
An initial filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100 US) must be paid by the claimant within 72 hours of the filing of the claim by a method stated when filing the claim. A claim will be considered filed when the initial online arbitration form is submitted, but will not become "active" until confirmation is received that the filing fee has been tendered. 

The Arbitrator, or expert appointed by the Arbitrator, will review the auction information, and may inspect the item. The Arbitrator may then issue a decision or require the claimant and respondent to provide written evidence and written submissions along with photos following which the Arbitrator shall make a final decision. The Arbitrator may also permit oral submissions by way of teleconference. If the Arbitrator finds that the respondent misrepresented the condition of the item, or failed to disclose information as required by this agreement with respect to a condition or description, where the costs of correcting or repairing such condition, or the difference in value of the item as a result of the condition is deemed by the Arbitrator exceeds $400.00 before tax, inspection, transportation, and/or GDTD fees (the "Deemed Amount"), then the Arbitrator shall order that the respondent refund the auction close amount, all documented transportation, inspection, and GDTD fees associated with the transaction, or adjust the close auction price to a mutually agreed upon price. The respondent will also be assigned the responsibility to pay any and all Arbitration costs, including the initial $100 filing fee. If the Deemed Amount is less than $400.00, or the Arbitrator finds no action against the respondent, the Arbitrator shall dismiss the claim and direct that the claimant pay all costs of the Arbitration. 

If an arbitration hearing is conducted pursuant to the above mediation process, and the claimed amount is less than three thousand dollars ($3,000 US), an additional fee of one hundred dollars ($100 US) shall be paid by both the claimant and the respondent. If the claimed amount is three thousand dollars ($3,000 US) or more, then the additional fee to both the claimant and the respondent will be five hundred dollars ($500 US). 

10.3 Arbitration Process

The hearing shall be conducted by telephone with all parties participating and having an ability to hear the testimony of the other party and to hear the assigned arbitrator. At this hearing, the claimant shall proceed first and shall explain the claim and give justification or reasons to support it. The claimant may have other persons with knowledge of the claim offer their verbal statement. The respondent shall proceed after the conclusion of claimant's presentation and shall offer any justification or reasons that the claim is not accurate or that an award is not appropriate. The respondent may have other persons with knowledge of the claim offer their verbal statement as well. An electronic record shall be made of all oral statements of the parties and other persons. 

At the conclusion of the presentations of the parties, the arbitrator shall consider all the material presented by the parties, their statements, and the statements of other persons made during the hearing and shall issue a final and binding decision in writing that shall decide the issues presented based solely upon the information presented by the parties and the law of the jurisdiction governing the contract or dispute. The arbitration decision shall briefly explain the reason for the award. The decision shall be issued and faxed or emailed to the parties within 24 hours of the arbitration hearing.

The jurist selected shall be paid by the arbitration company a fee reflective of the time spent resolving the dispute submitted regardless of its outcome. 

If a party objects to the appointment of a jurist, that objection shall be filed within 24 hours of their appointment and shall be resolved by the program administrator immediately. The decision of the program administrator is final and binding upon the parties in all 50 states in the United States . 

10.5 Appointment of Costs and Fees

10.6 Arbitration Judgment 
The following rules will apply to the Arbitration Act: 

a. All decisions of the arbitrator are FINAL and BINDING upon the parties and shall be enforceable as a judgment in any state or federal court having jurisdiction. There shall be no rights of appeal from any such decisions. 

b. Judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 

c. In the case of an item refund, the costs of the item Arbitration shall include all costs payable for the Arbitrator's fees (including the inspection), the transportation fees of the item, all GDTD fees, and in respect to items exported, additional export related costs.
