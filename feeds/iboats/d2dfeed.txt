No matter what type of boating you do, we offer a full array of fiberglass and non-fiberglass accessories so you may rig a boat just the way you want. <br><br>Our hulls are built using a proven and patented sealed foam box beam construction process. (U.S. Patent # 4,495,884.) <br><br>Each Carolina Skiff has no wood to rot, built of 100% composite materials with a high density foam core transom. Nearly the whole process of building a Carolina Skiff is done in one step. The stringers are formed as we fiberglass each pre-cased foam log into place, one at a time. This process is patented so there can only be one true Carolina Skiff.<br><br>This price is for the bare hull only.

Of course, that is Hewescraft’s specialty. Hunting? You wouldn’t believe the game that has been bagged and hauled home in a Sportsman. Beaching it at a remote camp site? Not in a fiberglass boat, but absolutely with a Sportsman. Pulling the kids on the tube on a sunny afternoon? They’ll love it. A romantic sunset cruise on the lake? You’re missing out if you don’t. (Just remember to wash out the leftovers from your recent fishing trip!) Sportsman models are often the first boat you purchase. And they’re good enough to be the last.<br><br>Tough - This is not your father’s riveted boat. Sure, Hewescraft made riveted boats at one time. But that was years ago! We have been making aluminum boats for nearly 60 years—true pioneers in the industry. Being first means that we’re often copied, but never reproduced. It didn’t take too long for us to realize that an all-welded boat was superior in strength and toughness to a riveted boat. And feel free to compare us to fiberglass...at 10 times the sheer strength of fiberglass, our aluminum hulls will take you places you could never go in other boats. <br><br>Economical - It’s no mystery why the Sportsman is Hewescraft’s top selling boat model and extremely popular with fishermen in the United States and Canada. Whether for use on rivers or lakes, the 16’, 18’ and 20’ Sportsman models are engineered with serious fishing functionality and are the best value on the water. With hull bottom construction of .160” gauge aluminum and sides built with .100” gauge aluminum, these boats are light weight but not wimpy. The size and weight makes them easy to tow, easy to store, easy on fuel, and easy on your wallet. But there will be nothing easy about hauling in all the fish these boats catch!|85|Honda Marine|90|0||||||Black|http://www.iboats.com/sites/calumetmarine/site_page_5724/images/l_brinkofinsanity016.jpg|http://www.iboats.com/sites/calumetmarine/site_page_5724/images/l_brinkofinsanity011.jpg|http://www.iboats.com/sites/calumetmarine/site_page_5724/images/l_brinkofinsanity012.jpg|http://www.iboats.com/sites/calumetmarine/site_page_5724/images/l_brinkofinsanity013.jpg|||||||||||||||||

Pick two things you can’t have enough of (aside from the obvious). On a boat, it is undoubtedly space and time. Never before has there been a boat that delivers delicious doses of both like the MariStar 245. <br><br>The 245’s sweeping, SuperFly front bow and massive interior and cockpit can manage up to 18 people in ergonomic ecstasy. The seating doesn’t come at the expense of all your stuff, either. From its triple-hatch rear sundeck to the underseat storage in the main cabin – all the way to the tip of its 24 feet – there is abundant space for everyone to bring along their own personal stash. Each compartment is complimented by 40-ounce carpeting, to help deaden sound and vibration in the cabin, but to also keep scratches at bay. <br><br>Time stands still on a 245. The most watersports friendly 24-foot boat ever made, the 245’s driver’s center turns any dad into homegrown superhero – cockpit management has never been easier thanks to MariStar’s plentiful, predicable power and handling, including MasterCraft Cruise speed-holding, fingertip stereo control and rack-and-pinion steering system. The wakes of a MariStar are more rounded than those found behind any I/O, making it un-intimidating and effortless for first-timers to cross on a pair of skis. With its removable ski pylon and oversized boarding platform, a MariStar makes it easy to make memories no family will ever forget. <br><br>MariStar 245: The ultimate time and space machine.|102||||||90|||White/Navy Blue|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss003.jpg|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss001.jpg|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss005.jpg|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss006.jpg|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss002.jpg|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss007.jpg|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss008.jpg|http://www.mtdoraboats.com/site_page_647/images/l_27mc245ss004.jpg|||||||||||||

His website is acestriperguide.com.  This boat is fully equipped including auto pilot troll motor and X-15 Lowrance depthfinder.<br>*****************************************************<br>Everglades Boats has combined its legendary RAMCAP construction process with a deep V-hull to offer the Everglades 211cc, a new unsinkable bay boat with outstanding rough water-handling capabilities. With a sharp entry and a steep 21-degree deadrise, the Everglades 211cc slices smoothly through the chop and delivers a solid, dry ride, even in the sharpest of turns. Under the gunwale, the stainless-steel toe-rail allows greater stability when fishing while the knee-high coaming bolsters increase comfort and safety. The spacious 71 sq ft cockpit also features a 35-gallon in-floor fish box with pump. Unique to the new 211cc are two Everglades' signature built-in stern seats, facing slightly inward for conviviality. Designed for total comfort, these seats fold down into 2'6"-square aft casting platforms when it's time for some serious fishing. While most fishing boats have a seat or a leaning post, the Everglades 211cc offers the exclusive Combo Leaning Post-Command Seat that flips up to turn into a comfortable leaning post. Aft, the built-in 40-gallon livewell comes with a green-tinted lid and side hinged doors. The optional hardtop features red L.E.D. lights, white spreader lights, built-in speakers and electronics boxes. The adjustable sliding windshield locks in any position. The console sports six side rod holders in addition to the four rocket launchers along the top's aft edge. The hardtop also features six openings to accommodate rod tips. The Everglades 211cc is packed with more standard fishing and family-friendly features than any other bay boat on the market. All together, the Everglades 211cc can accommodate up to 16 fishing rods, including 6 under the gunwales, 3 on each side of the console mounted at waist level, and 4 at the back of the optional hardtop. Like all Everglades boats, the 211cc uses the patented RAMCAP construction process to create an unsinkable family fishing boat for the safest experience on the water.|97||||||66||||http://www.belvederemarine.com/site_page_979/images/l_zpfile000.jpg|http://www.belvederemarine.com/site_page_979/images/l_ladowpic.jpg|||||||||||||||||||
